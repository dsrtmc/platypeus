# About

Platypeus is a website where you can measure your typing speed. It offers a basic account and a scoreboard system, as well as some multiplayer racing capabilities. The default test uses the 200 most common English words as the wordlist.

This project is largely inspired by [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com), which we believe to be an incredible creation that tens of thousands of users use daily, not without reason. The racing system was loosely modeled after [TypeRacer](https://play.typeracer.com), which has been the leading typing-test racing platform for more than 15 years now.

The main motivation behind Platypeus was a combination of a desire to understand how two great services we personally use are created, as well as a few minor subjective imperfections both platforms 'suffered' from. Platypeus is selfishly tweaked so that it would please the developer who made it, enabling them to boot up the application without wishing, 'Oh, I wish this feature were different'.

# Credits

[Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com) - by far the most advanced, supported, and arguably the most aesthetically pleasing typing test on the Internet, was the main inspiration behind Platypeus.

[TypeRacer](https://play.typeracer.com) - for being the go-to typing-test racing application since the dawn of time, largely impacting the decision to create this rendition of Platypeus.
